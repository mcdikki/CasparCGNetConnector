Features
--------

This connector framework was written for [CasparsPlayoutClient][3] and offers the follwing features:  
  * easy connection
  * duplex communication with the [CasparCG Server][1]
  * built in [CasparCG Server][1] command classes 
    * with version control
    * easy runtime exploreation of commands and their paramters - perfect for UI building
    * command and parameter discriptions
  * ready to use media objects for OO usage
  * plaintext command sending


Quick Start
-----------

See the [Wiki][4] for a more detailed and complete Guide.

Add CasparCGNetConnector to your project and import the namespace where needed
<pre>import CasparCGNetConnector</pre>

Now you need a CasparCGNetConnector.CasparCGConnection object
<pre>Dim con as new CasparCGConnection(server,port)</pre>
where *server* is the IP or DNS name of the [CasparCG Server][1] and *port* the TCP port nummber.  

For sending commands to the [CasparCG Server][1], there are two possible ways:
  * creating a CasparCGNetConnector.Command object and call it's execute method
    <pre>
Dim cmd as new PlayCommand(channel,layer,medianame)
cmd.execute(con)</pre>
  * send a plaintext command
    <pre>
con.sendCommand("play 1-1 amb")</pre>  

If you are interrested in the [CasparCG Server][1] response, you can check the CasparCGResponse.
Both, the ***execute()*** and the ***sendCommand()*** method is returning a CasparCGResponse object holding:
  * the [CasparCG Server][1] response code
    <pre>response.getCode() as integer</pre>
  * the received data as string
    <pre>response.getData()</pre>
  * the received data as xml (if any)
    <pre>response.getXML()</pre>
  * the executed command as string
    <pre>response.getCommand()</pre>
  * the raw server message as it was received
    <pre>response.getServerMessage()</pre>
  * the response status
    <pre>response.isOK()
response.isERR()
response.isINFO()
response.isUNKNOWN()</pre>  

This should be enough to give you a good start.
There are more functions to explore.
Just check out the code.


Development
-----------

CasparCGNetConnector won't be actively maintained any longer.
Since I'm not using it anymore, I can't afford the time needed to keep track with the development of the CasparCG server.
If you still use it and find a bug, feel free to open an issue and I may find the time to look into it, but don't expect it be closed any time sone :-(
